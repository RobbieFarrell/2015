							<h2>The task</h2>
							<p>Using the following scenario, perform a search on the Skyscanner website using our flights product: You and your partner, and your two children (one of whom is under 2 years old) are travelling from Edinburgh to Washington International, departing 9th November 2015 and returning 2 weeks later. You are on a budget, so Economy is the only option and you are open to non-direct flights.</p>
							<p>We would like you to analyse this view and taking a mobile-first approach present:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The goals this view is trying to achieve.</li>
								<li>Challenges a user may face with this view</li>
								<li>Any mobile specific challenges you think this view has?</li>
								<li>What you think works well</li>
								<li>What metrics you would use to analyse deeper</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Using this information and researching into what our competitors both within and out with the travel sector do well, we would like you to present 2-3 options for how we could improve this view and help ultimately increase conversion. For the purposes of this part of the task, static wireframes and mocks are acceptable.</p>
							<p>Please do not be constrained by the current look and feel or the way in which data is currently presented - we are open to radical change.</p>
							<p>Having investigated options, we would like you to choose one design to mock up fully into an HTML prototype (please note, we are not looking for production quality code, we simply would like you to be able to show this on a couple of devices – we rely on our Front End Engineers to do the heavy lifting!). This should be presented alongside rationale on how you would aim to test, validate and roll out this design.	</p>	



							<h2>Understanding the goals</h2>
							<ul>
<li><strong>The goals this view is trying to achieve</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Show the best flight packages available to the user in price ascending order initially</li>
<li>Get users to sign up for price alerts</li>
<li>Provide the user with the option to change their dates with ease</li>
<li>Provide the user with the option to filter their results by direct or multiple stops, flight times, airlines</li>
<li>Promote the car hire and hotels section of the site (desktop only)</li>
<li>Show some ads  (desktop only)</li>
<li>Help the user find the right flight for them and proceed to booking it</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Challenges a user may face with this view</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Comparing two different flights side by side is not possible or two different days</li>
<li>Option to save flight details/email them is not possible</li>
<li>Scrolling through pages of content can be tedious</li>
<li>It’s not possible to select outgoing or return flights individually</li>
<li>There is a lot of data to read through and some of it is unnecessary and could be hidden in a reveal more info window</li>
<li>Understanding the total cost of the flight can be difficult</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Any mobile specific challenges you think this view has?</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Scrolling through pages of content can involve a lot of scrolling up and down</li>
<li>Filters and sorting options are tricky to use and require extra work to scroll through different options</li>
<li>Different menus that need to be opened can be distracting</li>
<li>The excessive amount of text makes the interface quite busy</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>What you think works well</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>The page is reasonably well laid out so scanning through the results is a quick process</li>
<li>Important buttons such as filters, sort options and date changing capabilities are placed near the top</li>
<li>It’s possible to see all important details about a flight without having to click the more details button</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>What metrics you would use to analyse deeper</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>How many users used the filters and section</li>
<li>How many users returned to the home page to try a new search rather than using the 'change search' facility at the top</li>
<li>How many users clicked on the more details link for a flight</li>
<li>How long a user stayed on the page before trying a new search</li>
<li>How many users used the pagination</li>
<li>Most popular screen sizes</li>
<li>Exit pages - where did users leave the page?</li>
<li>Conversion rates</li>
</ul>

							</ul>



							<h2>Market research</h2>
							<p>As part of the research phase I gathered a list of competitors and other website that I could draw inpsirations and market trends from. Because there is a large amount of competitors I decided to focus on 6 websites: Google Flights, Kayak, Hipmunk, Expedia, Ebookers &amp; Edreams. I spent some time navigating all websites on desktop and mobile and then got screenshots of the key flows.</p>

							<p>The next stage was to evaluate each site under different criteria to find out what each site did well or did not. I used the following criterias for my analysis:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Loading time &amp; feedback</li>
								<li>How intuitive is the UI</li>
								<li>Layout of content</li>
								<li>Visual design</li>
								<li>Desktop vs mobile layout</li>
								<li>Filters</li>
								<li>Stand-out feature</li>
							</ul>

							</div>

							<p>Full analysis can be viewed on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bfklhg6B-BrN-ocGh4TOUwCMOQTToBGZzzE4GMJsWj4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive</a></p>

							<h2>User research</h2>
							<p>I picked 6 parents to fill out a survery form about Skyscanner and their opinions on the website. I got them to run through the same scenario I had to and comment on how easy it was to navigate, filter and differentiate between results and then give their feedback.</p>
							<p>Full survery can be viewed on <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18GpmIKXoixXz_VzFCLgzvEurSKCNpXF_LvZlolFJuc0/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank">Google Drive</a></p>

							<h2>What direction to take</h2>
							<p>After my market and user research I had a clear understanding of what users would be looking for along with a list of potential ideas to explore in my designs:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Reduce vertical height of listings by minimising text used</li>
								<li>Make it easier to modify searched terms inline</li>
								<li>Add option to choose different flights rather than Skyscanner choosing both flights</li>
								<li>When a user scrolls to the bottom of the page auto load more results </li>
								<li>Add option to save itinerary </li>
								<li>Add flexible date option to help increase chance of finding cheapest date</li>
								<li>Introduce a more colourful and vibrant colour scheme</li>
								<li>Recommend flights to the user</li>
								<li>Have a rating for flights</li>
								<li>Use a common sense filter to suggest flights which take stops, time, money etc. into consideration and don’t suggest crazy stopover times to save a few quid</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Sketching and lo-fi wireframes</h2>
							<p>Once I had the ideas in my head it was time to put them down on paper. By spending about an hour with a pen and paper I could sketch out some rough ideas before moving over the Balsamiq to wireframe 2 ideas I had.</p>

							</div>

							<img class="center-me port-img" src="img/portfolio/skyscanner-sketches.jpg" alt="Skyscanner">

							<div class="span9 offset1">

							<p><a href="assets/Skyscanner-day-view-wireframe.pdf" target="_blank">Wireframe 1</a> &amp; <a href="assets/Skyscanner-day-view-wireframe-v2.pdf" target="_blank">Wireframe 2</a></p>

							<h2>Visual designs</h2>
							<p>I only mocked up 1 screen on mobile and desktop to get a general feel for the design. By spending less time in Photoshop I could then spend more time design in the browser.</p>

							</div>

							<img class="center-me port-img" src="img/portfolio/skyscanner-ui-explorations-v1.jpg" alt="Skyscanner">

							<div class="span9 offset1">

							<h2>Front-end development</h2>
							<p>Due to a lack of time I created the code from scratch rather than working with a framework. I aimed to design most elements within the browsers on the go. It is currently optimised for desktop, iPhone and iPad.</p>

							<h2>Evaluating the work</h2>
							<p>I originally explored two ideas in my wireframes and both were feasible options. Ideally I'd like to fully prototype both of them and use them for A/B or usability testing. Some of the metrics I'd analyse during these tests would be:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>How users interact with the filters? Is there any new ones they'd like to see?</li>
								<li>Is there enough information displayed about the flights or is there any other important to see?</li>
								<li>Do they prefer seeing both the outgoing and return flights on one screen or being able to choose both one at a time?</li>
								<li>Was the pagination used or did users start a new search if they couldn't find the right flight on the first page?</li>
								<li>If the user couldn't find the right flights for them, find suggestions on how they'd look for the correct one (filters, sorting orders etc).</li>
							</ul>
